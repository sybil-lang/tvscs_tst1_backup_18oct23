| Hooks
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This file lets you define hooks to extend Customer Portal functionality. Hooks allow
| you to specify custom code that you wish to execute before and after many
| important events that occur within Customer Portal. This custom code can modify data,
| perform custom validation, and return customized error messages to display to your users.
|
| Hooks are defined by specifying the location where you wish the hook to run as the array index
| and setting that index to an array of 3 items, class, function, and filepath. The 'class' index
| is the case-sensitive name of the custom model you wish to use. The 'function' index is the name
| of the function within the 'class' you wish to call. Finally, the 'filepath' is the location to
| your model, which will automatically be prefixed by models/custom/. The 'filepath' index only
| needs a value if your model is contained within a subfolder

|Examples
|------------------
|
| Example 1 - Call the sendFeedback function immediately after an incident is created
|             using the Immediateincidentfeedback_model
|             (located at /models/custom/immediateincidentfeedback_model.php).
|
| $rnHooks['post_incident_create'] = array(
|        'class' => 'Immediateincidentfeedback_model',
|        'function' => 'sendFeedback',
|        'filepath' => ''
|    );

|=========================================================================================================

| Example 2 - Call the copyLogin function immediately before a contact is created using
|             the Customcontact_model (located at /models/custom/contact/customcontact_model.php)
|
| $rnHooks['pre_contact_create'] = array(
|        'class' => 'Customcontact_model',
|        'function' => 'copyLogin',
|        'filepath' => 'contact'
|    );
|=========================================================================================================

| Example 3 - First call the customValidation function from the Myfeedback_model
|             (located at /models/custom/feedback/myfeedback_model.php) then call
|             the sendFeedback function from Immediateincidentfeedback_model (located at
|             /models/custom/immediateincidentfeedback_model.php). The first function will be called
|             before the feedback is submitted. The second will be called after.
|
| $rnHooks['pre_feedback_submit'][] = array(
|        'class' => 'Myfeedback_model',
|        'function' => 'customValidation',
|        'filepath' => 'feedback'
|    );
| $rnHooks['post_feedback_submit'][] = array(
|        'class' => 'Immediateincidentfeedback_model',
|        'function' => 'sendFeedback',
|        'filepath' => ''
|    );
